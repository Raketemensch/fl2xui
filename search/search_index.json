Linux (dark theme) # MacOS # Windows # Features # Multiple logs (Blackbox, OTX/ETX CSV) Summary information Easy access to common visualisation options. User Interface # File / index selection area (1) # Log... : Opens a file chooser to select log files. Multiple files may be selected. The files may be a combination of Blackbox logs or OpenTX / EdgeTX CSV logs. Output... : Opens a file chooser to select the output directory. The defaults (no selection) are: Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS : Current (working) directory, typically $HOME when launched from a desktop environment. Windows : \"Documents\" (e.g. C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Documents ). Mission... : Optional mission file (single selection). MW XML format (e.g. from mwp or inav configurator. Index : If 0 (default), processes all logs in (each) file; if non zero, processes a single log at the specified index. Visualisation Options (2) # Drag and drop On Linux / FreeBSD, you can also drag and drop logs and mission files into this area, at least with the Gnome desktop environment. DMS : Display positions as degrees / minutes / seconds ( DD:MM:SS.sss ) vice decimal degress ( DD.dddddd ). Extrude : Extrude flight points the ground. Efficiency Layer : Include an efficiency layer in the output. RSSI as default : Set the RSSI layer as the default (vice Flight Mode). KML : Generate uncompressed KML (vice compressed KMZ). Gradient : Select the colour gradient for RSSI / Efficiency layer) Red - shades of red Green / Red - Green (best) to red (worst) Yellow / Orange / Red - Yellow (best) to red (worst) via orange Output Area (3) # Output Area : Scrolled window showing process or error messages. Progress bar and Run button (4) # Run button is enabled when log files have been selected An oscillating progress bar is displayed when a conversion is in process (after clicking \"Run\"). Installation # Linux, FreeBSD # Common GTK packages Debian package *.deb for Debian / Ubuntu and derivatives in fl2xui release area. Easily built from source # Once (setup) meson build --buildtype=release --strip --prefix=~/.local # Build and install to ~/.local/bin (add to PATH if necessary) # or specify some other PATH element (/usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, ~/bin) meson install -C build Windows # Win64 Zip file ( fl2xui release area) provided with shortcut launcher. Can be built from source using Msys2 (as Linux). It is recommended that blackbox_decode and flightlog2kml are in the fl2xui\\bin directory (as in the release archive).
